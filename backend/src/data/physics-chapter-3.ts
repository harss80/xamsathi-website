If |A+B| = |A−B|, angle between them is:", options: ["0°", "45°", "60°", "90°"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "If the magnitudes of the sum and difference of two equal vectors are equal, the vectors must be perpendicular to each other. Hence the angle is 90°." },
    { text: "2. If |A|=3, |B|=4 and |A×B|=12, then angle between them is:", options: ["30°", "45°", "60°", "90°"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "|A×B| = |A||B|sinθ. So, 12 = 3 × 4 × sinθ => sinθ = 1. Therefore, θ = 90°." },
    { text: "3. A vector A makes equal angles with x, y, z axes. Its direction cosines are:", options: ["(1/√3,1/√3,1/√3)", "(1/3,1/3,1/3)", "(1/√2,1/√2,0)", "(1,1,1)"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Since direction cosines l,m,n satisfy l² + m² + n² = 1, and here l=m=n (equal angles), 3l²=1 => l = ±1/√3." },
    { text: "4. If A·B = |A×B|, angle between vectors is:", options: ["30°", "45°", "60°", "90°"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "AB cosθ = AB sinθ => tanθ = 1 => θ = 45°." },

If time of flight is doubled keeping u same, θ becomes:", options: ["2θ", "sin⁻¹(2sinθ)", "90−θ", "Impossible"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "T = 2u sinθ / g. If T' = 2T, then sinθ' = 2sinθ, so θ' = sin⁻¹(2sinθ). This is impossible if 2sinθ > 1, but algebraically it's option B." },
    { text: "7. Two projectiles fired at 30° and 60° with same speed. Ratio of maximum heights:", options: ["1:1", "1:3", "3:1", "1:√3"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "H = u²sin²θ / 2g. H₁/H₂ = sin²30° / sin²60° = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1:3." },

H equals:", options: ["u² sin²θ /2g", "u² sin2θ /g", "u² cos²θ /2g", "u²/g"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Horizontal range is u² sin2θ /g. If it matches strictly horizontal range R = ut from h, deriving the exact relation is complex, but the range of an angled projectile alone is u² sin2θ /g." },
    { text: "9. If range is 3 times maximum height, angle of projection is:", options: ["30°", "45°", "53° (approx)", "75°"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "R = 3H. (u²sin2θ)/g = 3(u²sin²θ)/(2g). 2sinθcosθ = (3/2)sin²θ => tanθ = 4/3 => θ ≈ 53°." },
    { text: "10. A particle projected at 45°. Velocity at half maximum height makes angle with horizontal equal to:", options: ["30°", "tan⁻¹(1/2)", "tan⁻¹(1/√2)", "60°"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "At max height H, v_y = 0. At H/2, v_y² = u_y² - 2g(H/2). Since H = u_y²/2g, v_y = u_y/√2. Horizontal v_x = u_x. Since angle is 45°, u_x = u_y. Thus tanα = v_y/v_x = (u/√2)/u = 1/√2." },
    { text: "11. Horizontal range is independent of mass because:", options: ["g independent of mass", "u independent", "acceleration independent of mass", "Both A and C"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "Acceleration due to gravity (g) acts on all objects equally regardless of their mass (neglecting air resistance), making the range independent of mass." },

    { text: "15. If a projectile has same initial and final speed, it means:", options: ["Air resistance present", "No air resistance", "Acceleration zero", "Velocity zero"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "In a uniform gravitational field with no air resistance, energy is conserved, so launch speed equals impact speed at the same elevation." },
    { text: "16. For maximum range on inclined plane, θ depends on:", options: ["g only", "Inclination angle", "Mass", "Height"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "The optimal angle of projection depends on the inclination angle (β) of the plane. Mostly, it is (π/4 - β/2) measured from the plane." },

Ratio of horizontal to vertical component at impact equals:", options: ["cotθ", "tanθ", "cosθ/sinθ", "None"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Impact ratio: |v_x| / |v_y|. Since v_x = u cosθ and |v_y| = u sinθ, the ratio is cosθ / sinθ = cotθ." },

    { text: "24. Range on a planet where g becomes 4g is:", options: ["R", "R/4", "4R", "R/2"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Range R = u²sin2θ / g. If g becomes 4g, R' = u²sin2θ / 4g = R/4." },
    { text: "25. Time of flight is independent of:", options: ["Horizontal velocity", "Vertical velocity", "g", "None"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Time of flight T = 2u_y / g, so it is strictly determined by the initial vertical velocity component, completely independent of the horizontal velocity." },
    { text: "26. Resultant of two forces 3N and 4N acting at 90°:", options: ["1N", "5N", "7N", "12N"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Resultant = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5N." },

    { text: "29. If angle goes from 30° to 45°, horizontal range:", options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains same", "Becomes zero"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Range R is proportional to sin(2θ). sin(60°) = √3/2, sin(90°) = 1. So range increases and hits its maximum at 45°." },
    { text: "30. The component of a vector A along vector B is:", options: ["A cosθ", "A sinθ", "A . B", "(A . B / B)"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "The scalar projection of A onto B is |A|cosθ. Since A . B = |A||B|cosθ, the component is (A . B) / |B|." },

    { text: "32. For maximum projectile range, the launch angle should be:", options: ["30°", "45°", "60°", "90°"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Range R = u²sin(2θ)/g. Maximum when sin(2θ) = 1, meaning 2θ = 90°, so θ = 45°." },
    { text: "33. If air resistance is considered, max height of a projectile:", options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains same", "Cannot say"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Air resistance opposes the upward motion, leading to a smaller peak vertical velocity and a lower maximum height." },
    { text: "34. Acceleration of a projectile at apex is entirely:", options: ["Tangential", "Normal", "Zero", "Horizontal"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "At apex, velocity is horizontal and acceleration g is vertical, so the total acceleration is normal (perpendicular) to the velocity." },

    { text: "40. If a man swims upstream and downstream, which speed is larger?", options: ["Upstream", "Downstream", "Same", "Depends on width"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Downstream speed gets a boost from the river current (Velocity of man + Velocity of river), making it consistently larger." },
    { text: "41. Projection angle for H_max = R/4 is:", options: ["45°", "60°", "90°", "30°"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "R = 4H cotθ. If H = R/4, 4(R/4) cotθ = R => R cotθ = R => cotθ = 1 => θ = 45°." },
