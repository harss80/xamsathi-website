    { text: "31. If fm doubles, bandwidth:", options: ["Doubles", "Halves", "Same", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "AM Bandwidth is 2fm. If fm doubles, the bandwidth becomes 2(2fm) = 4fm, doubling the original size." },
    { text: "32. Modulation index m =", options: ["Am/Ac", "Ac/Am", "fm/fc", "fc/fm"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Modulation index is the ratio of the message signal amplitude (Am) to the carrier wave amplitude (Ac)." },
    { text: "33. If m=0:", options: ["No modulation", "Over modulation", "Distortion", "Noise"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "An index of 0 means the modulating signal has zero amplitude, implying no change to the carrier." },
    { text: "34. Ionosphere reflects:", options: ["Low freq", "High freq", "Radio freq", "Optical"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "High frequency (HF) or shortwave radio bands are primarily reflected by the ionosphere." },
    { text: "35. TV transmission uses:", options: ["VHF/UHF", "LF", "Audio", "DC"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) are standard for television broadcasting." },
    { text: "36. Amplitude modulation requires:", options: ["Linear modulator", "Detector", "Rectifier", "Transistor"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Modulator circuits typically require a non-linear element (like a transistor or diode) configured for Amplitude Modulation." },
    { text: "37. Noise figure measures:", options: ["Quality", "Noise", "Power", "Frequency"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Noise figure quantifies the degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio caused by components in a system." },
    { text: "38. Signal-to-noise ratio high means:", options: ["Better quality", "Poor", "Same", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "A high SNR means the signal power is significantly higher than the noise power, resulting in a clear reception." },
    { text: "39. Carrier wave equation:", options: ["Ac sin(ωct)", "Am sin(ωmt)", "DC", "Constant"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The unmodulated carrier wave is a high-frequency sinusoid: c(t) = Ac sin(ωct)." },
    { text: "40. Envelope of AM contains:", options: ["Information", "Noise", "Carrier", "Power"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The bounding envelope of an AM wave exactly traces the shape of the original modulating baseband signal." },
    { text: "41. Over modulation causes:", options: ["Distortion", "Clear signal", "Silence", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "When the modulation index exceeds 1, the envelope crosses zero, leading to severe envelope distortion." },
    { text: "42. Superheterodyne receiver uses:", options: ["Mixer", "Detector", "Amplifier", "Antenna"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "A mixer combines the incoming signal with a local oscillator frequency to produce an intermediate frequency (IF)." },
    { text: "43. IF in radio ≈:", options: ["455 kHz", "1 kHz", "1 MHz", "10 Hz"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "455 kHz is the standard intermediate frequency (IF) in AM superheterodyne radio receivers." },
    { text: "44. Digital communication uses:", options: ["Binary", "Analog", "Continuous", "Sound"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Digital signals represent information as discrete binary values (0s and 1s)." },
    { text: "45. Bit rate unit:", options: ["bps", "Hz", "J", "W"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Bits per second (bps) indicates how many binary digits are transmitted or processed per unit time." },
    { text: "46. Optical fiber works on:", options: ["Total internal reflection", "Refraction", "Diffraction", "Interference"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Light travels through an optical fiber by constantly reflecting off the cladding via Total Internal Reflection." },
    { text: "47. Noise mainly generated in:", options: ["Channel", "Antenna", "Ground", "Sky"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Thermal agitation, atmospheric disturbances, and interference mostly introduce noise within the transmission channel." },
    { text: "48. Carrier power wasted in AM because:", options: ["No info", "High freq", "Noise", "Sideband"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The carrier wave alone (without sidebands) lacks message information, so its power does not transmit useful data." },
    { text: "49. Maximum efficiency of AM:", options: ["33%", "50%", "100%", "66%"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "At 100% modulation (m=1), only 33.3% of the total transmitted power is in the information-carrying sidebands." },
    { text: "50. Frequency modulation gives:", options: ["Better SNR", "Poor SNR", "Same", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "FM systems inherently suppress amplitude noise, offering a vastly superior Signal-to-Noise Ratio over AM." },
    { text: "51. Satellite communication uses:", options: ["Microwave", "Audio", "DC", "LF"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Microwaves easily penetrate the ionosphere and are ideal for deep-space and satellite uplinks/downlinks." },
    { text: "52. Repeater used to:", options: ["Amplify", "Detect", "Rectify", "Modulate"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "A repeater receives a weakened signal, amplifies it, and retransmits it to extend the communication range." },
    { text: "53. Message signal frequency is:", options: ["Low", "High", "Same as carrier", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Baseband or message signals (like audio) normally possess low frequencies compared to radio-frequency carriers." },
    { text: "54. Carrier amplitude constant in:", options: ["FM", "AM", "Both", "None"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "In FM, the frequency varies according to the message, while the carrier's amplitude remains strictly unchanged." },
    { text: "55. Envelope detection possible in:", options: ["AM", "FM", "PM", "Digital"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Envelope detectors simply follow the peaks of the AM wave to recover the baseband signal effortlessly." },
    { text: "56. Bandwidth of FM > AM because:", options: ["Frequency variation", "Amplitude", "Noise", "Carrier"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "FM requires a much wider band to accommodate the virtually infinite number of sidebands formed by frequency deviation." },
    { text: "57. Effective height of antenna affects:", options: ["Range", "Noise", "Modulation", "Power"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "A taller antenna significantly extends the radio horizon and increases the spatial coverage limit." },
    { text: "58. EM waves propagate in:", options: ["Vacuum", "Medium", "Both", "None"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "Electromagnetic waves can travel through free space (vacuum) as well as dielectric media." },
    { text: "59. Communication without modulation:", options: ["Not practical", "Possible", "Better", "Clear"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Without modulation, transmitting low-frequency signals directly requires impractically gigantic antennas." },
