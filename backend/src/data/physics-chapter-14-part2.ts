    { text: "36. Transformer works on:", options: ["AC", "DC", "Both", "None"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Requires changing magnetic flux, hence works only on AC." },
    { text: "37. In ideal transformer:", options: ["P_in = P_out", "V_in = V_out", "I_in = I_out", "Loss maximum"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Ideal implies no power loss, 100% efficient." },
    { text: "38. Step-up transformer increases:", options: ["Current", "Voltage", "Power", "Resistance"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Increases voltage, proportionally decreasing current." },

    { text: "46. In pure R, instantaneous power always:", options: ["Positive", "Negative", "Zero", "Alternating"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "P(t) = i(t)²R. Since square is positive, power is always positive." },

    { text: "48. If Q increases, bandwidth:", options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Same", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Bandwidth = Resonant Freq / Q. Higher Q means narrower bandwidth." },
    { text: "49. Resonance curve sharp when:", options: ["R small", "R large", "C large", "L small"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Lower resistance leads to higher peak current, sharper curve." },
    { text: "50. Inductor stores energy in:", options: ["Electric field", "Magnetic field", "Heat", "Resistance"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Induction relies entirely on the associated magnetic field." },
    { text: "51. Capacitor stores energy in:", options: ["Magnetic field", "Electric field", "Heat", "Current"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Capacitors maintain energy within the electric field between plates." },
    { text: "52. If φ=90°, power factor:", options: ["1", "0", "–1", "0.5"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Cos(90°) = 0. Pure reactive loads effectively consume zero average power." },
    { text: "53. AC can be transmitted efficiently because:", options: ["Low loss at high voltage", "High current", "DC property", "None"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "High voltage stepped up minimizes I²R losses." },

    { text: "56. Phase difference in resonance:", options: ["0°", "90°", "180°", "45°"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Z is purely resistive, so V and I are perfectly in phase." },
    { text: "57. Impedance minimum at:", options: ["Resonance", "High freq", "Low freq", "Zero freq"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Reactances cancel out; Z = R exactly at resonant frequency." },
    { text: "58. If R=0 in RLC, resonance current:", options: ["Infinite", "Zero", "Constant", "Finite"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Current = V/R. If R approaches 0, current approaches theoretical infinity." },
