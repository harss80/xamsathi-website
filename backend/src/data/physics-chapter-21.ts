    { text: "1. Communication means:", options: ["Transfer of energy", "Transfer of information", "Transfer of charge", "Transfer of mass"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Communication is the process of conveying information from one place to another." },
    { text: "2. Basic elements of communication system:", options: ["Transmitter", "Receiver", "Channel", "All"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "A typical communication system essentially requires a transmitter, a communication channel, and a receiver." },
    { text: "3. Signal carrying information is:", options: ["Carrier", "Message signal", "Noise", "Bandwidth"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "The message signal holds the actual information or data to be transmitted." },
    { text: "4. Carrier wave is generally:", options: ["Low frequency", "High frequency", "Zero frequency", "DC"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "High frequency waves can travel longer distances without much attenuation and allow practical antenna sizes." },
    { text: "5. Modulation is:", options: ["Mixing of two frequencies", "Amplification", "Rectification", "Detection"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Modulation superimposes a low-frequency message signal onto a high-frequency carrier wave." },
    { text: "6. AM stands for:", options: ["Amplitude Modulation", "Audio Modulation", "Analog Mode", "Active Mode"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Amplitude Modulation is when the amplitude of the carrier wave varies in accordance with the message signal." },
    { text: "7. In AM, varies:", options: ["Frequency", "Phase", "Amplitude", "Wavelength"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "The carrier amplitude fluctuates according to the modulating signal's instantaneous magnitude." },
    { text: "8. In FM, varies:", options: ["Amplitude", "Phase", "Frequency", "Power"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "Frequency Modulation varies the frequency of the carrier wave based on the message signal." },
    { text: "9. Bandwidth of AM:", options: ["2fm", "fm", "fc", "2fc"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "AM bandwidth is twice the maximum frequency of the modulating signal (2fm)." },
    { text: "10. Modulation index (AM) ≤:", options: ["1", "2", "0", "∞"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "To avoid distortion, the modulation index must be kept less than or equal to 1." },
    { text: "11. If m > 1, signal:", options: ["Distorted", "Clear", "Silent", "Strong"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Over-modulation (m > 1) causes envelope distortion and loss of information during detection." },
    { text: "12. Power in AM ∝:", options: ["m²", "m", "1/m", "fc"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The power in the sidebands is proportional to the square of the modulation index (Pc * m²/2)." },
    { text: "13. Sky wave propagation used for:", options: ["Short distance", "Long distance", "Line of sight", "Optical"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Sky waves reflect off the ionosphere, enabling long-distance communication (SW band)." },
    { text: "14. Ground wave used for:", options: ["High freq", "Low freq", "Microwave", "Laser"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Ground waves are highly attenuated at higher frequencies, so they are mainly used for VLF/LF." },
    { text: "15. Line of sight needed for:", options: ["Radio", "TV", "Microwave", "All"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "Microwaves travel in straight lines and do not bend around the Earth's curvature significantly." },
    { text: "16. Maximum line-of-sight distance ∝:", options: ["√h", "h", "1/h", "h²"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Distance to the radio horizon is roughly √(2 * R * h), so it is proportional to √h." },
    { text: "17. Frequency range of audible sound:", options: ["20–20k Hz", "1–1k Hz", "20–200 Hz", "200–2000 Hz"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Human hearing ranges from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz." },
    { text: "18. Carrier frequency compared to signal:", options: ["Much lower", "Same", "Much higher", "Zero"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "Carriers must have a very high frequency for efficient radiation and spectrum multiplexing." },
    { text: "19. Demodulation done by:", options: ["Detector", "Amplifier", "Oscillator", "Modulator"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "A detector circuit extracts the original message signal from the modulated wave at the receiver." },
    { text: "20. Noise mainly affects:", options: ["Amplitude", "Phase", "Frequency", "Power"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Noise usually adds to the signal's amplitude, making AM more susceptible to noise than FM." },
    { text: "21. Total AM power:", options: ["Pc(1+m²/2)", "Pc", "Pc(1+m)", "Pc(m²)"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Total power Pt is the sum of carrier power and sideband power: Pt = Pc * (1 + m²/2)." },
    { text: "22. Sidebands in AM:", options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "AM produces two sidebands for each modulating frequency: Upper Sideband (USB) and Lower Sideband (LSB)." },
    { text: "23. Sideband frequencies:", options: ["fc ± fm", "fc", "fm", "2fc"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The sidebands are located symmetrically above and below the carrier frequency." },
    { text: "24. Bandwidth depends on:", options: ["Carrier", "Signal freq", "Amplitude", "Power"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Bandwidth equals 2 * fm, primarily governed by the highest frequency component of the message signal." },
    { text: "25. FM advantage:", options: ["Less noise", "High noise", "Low power", "Narrow band"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Since information is in frequency variations, amplitude noise can be clipped out without losing data." },
    { text: "26. FM bandwidth:", options: ["2(Δf + fm)", "2fm", "fm", "fc"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Carson's Rule estimates FM bandwidth as roughly 2(Δf + fm), where Δf is peak frequency deviation." },
