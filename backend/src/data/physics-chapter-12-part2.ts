    { text: "34. Magnetic susceptibility unit:", options: ["Dimensionless", "Tesla", "Weber", "Henry"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "χ = M/H. Both M and H are A/m, so χ has no units." },
    { text: "35. Diamagnetic substances have:", options: ["χ positive small", "χ negative small", "χ large positive", "χ infinite"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Diamagnetic materials weakly oppose the field, meaning a small negative susceptibility." },
    { text: "36. Paramagnetic substances have:", options: ["Small positive χ", "Negative χ", "Large χ", "Zero χ"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Paramagnetic materials are weakly attracted, hence a small positive susceptibility." },
    { text: "37. Ferromagnetic have:", options: ["Large positive χ", "Negative χ", "Zero χ", "Small χ"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Ferromagnetic materials strongly align with fields, giving a large positive χ." },
    { text: "38. If velocity doubles, radius becomes:", options: ["Double", "Half", "Same", "4 times"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Radius r = mv/qB. r is directly proportional to v." },
    { text: "39. Magnetic moment of electron due to spin called:", options: ["Bohr magneton", "Tesla", "Weber", "Ampere"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The intrinsic magnetic moment of an electron is expressed in units of Bohr magnetons." },

    { text: "41. Force between anti-parallel currents:", options: ["Attract", "Repel", "Zero", "Infinite"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Currents flowing in opposite directions create opposing fields that repel." },
    { text: "42. Unit of magnetic dipole moment:", options: ["A·m²", "Tesla", "Weber", "H"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Magnetic moment m = I·A, so Amperes times square meters." },
    { text: "43. Magnetic energy density:", options: ["B²/2μ₀", "μ₀B²", "B²μ₀", "B/μ₀"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Energy stored per unit volume in a magnetic field is B² / 2μ₀." },
    { text: "44. Magnetic permeability μ =", options: ["B/H", "H/B", "EB", "1/B"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Permeability relates B and H: B = μH => μ = B/H." },
    { text: "45. Inside ideal solenoid field uniform because:", options: ["Symmetry", "Zero flux", "Infinite wire", "Random"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "The tightly wound coils create a constant, uniform, parallel field inside by symmetry." },
    { text: "46. If q negative, direction of force:", options: ["Same", "Opposite", "Zero", "Infinite"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "F = q(v×B). A negative charge reverses the force vector direction." },
    { text: "47. Cyclotron radius independent of:", options: ["Velocity", "Magnetic field", "Charge", "Time period"], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: "Radius is dependent on v, B, and q/m, but Time period is exactly independent of radius and v." },
    { text: "48. Magnetic lines closer means:", options: ["Strong field", "Weak field", "Zero field", "No idea"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Density of field lines directly indicates the field strength." },

    { text: "50. Moving charge creates:", options: ["E only", "B only", "Both", "None"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "A moving electric charge generates both an electric field E and a magnetic field B." },
    { text: "51. If magnetic field zero, force =", options: ["qE", "qvB", "Zero", "Infinite"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Lorentz Force = q(E + v×B). If B=0, only the electric force qE remains." },
    { text: "52. Magnetic field inside toroid ∝", options: ["1/r", "r", "1/r²", "Constant"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "B = μ₀NI / 2πr. So B varies inversely with the radial distance r inside the toroid." },

    { text: "54. Earth’s magnetic field direction approx:", options: ["South to North", "North to South", "Upwards", "Downwards"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Earth's magnetic lines emerge essentially near the Geographic South and enter near the Geographic North." },
    { text: "55. Magnetic dipole aligns:", options: ["Perpendicular", "Parallel", "Anti-parallel", "Random"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "A dipole in an external field will naturally rotate to align itself parallel to the field." },
    { text: "56. Force on stationary charge in B-field:", options: ["Zero", "qB", "Infinite", "qvB"], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "F = q(v×B). If velocity v=0, magnetic force is identically zero." },
    { text: "57. If θ=180°, torque equals:", options: ["Max", "Zero", "Half", "Infinite"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Torque = mB sinθ. sin(180°) = 0, so Torque is zero (stable/unstable equilibrium)." },
